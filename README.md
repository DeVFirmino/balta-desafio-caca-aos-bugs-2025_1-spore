Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Firmino, and this is the space where I share my learning journey during the Bug Hunt 2025 challenge organized by balta.io. ðŸ‘»

Here youâ€™ll find the projects, exercises, and code Iâ€™ve been working on throughout the challenge.
The goal is to get hands-on experience, test ideas, and track my progress in the tech world.

About this challenge

In the Spore challenge, I had to prepare my local environment by downloading the applicationâ€™s source code, running migrations, and setting up environment variables.
During this process, I learned how to:

	â€¢	âœ… Use dotnet user-secrets
